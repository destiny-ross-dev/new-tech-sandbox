post-24441, Why It’s Hard Being Tiny And Cute, http://www.drjensdogblog.com/why-its-hard-being-tiny-and-cute/, April 29 2019 , Today, I want to talk about little dogs.  I was at a client’s home a few weeks ago, doing a behavior consultation for their adorable two-year-old Maltese mix.  “Chloe” had a tendency to get over-aroused and begin barking, jumping, and nipping over seemingly benign activities like family members putting on their coats, loading the dishwasher, or using their exercise equipment.  Chloe was a friendly dog who hopped happily onto the couch to greet me as soon as I sat down,… Read More  Read More 
post-22028, Show Me The Money: Why Your Dog Doesn’t Listen, Unless You’re Holding Food, http://www.drjensdogblog.com/show-me-the-money-why-your-dog-doesnt-listen-unless-youre-holding-food/, March 25 2019 , Today, I want to talk about one of the most common struggles I see with my behavior clients and their dogs.  Often, they’ve been through a basic obedience class or two, and their pup has learned a few skills.  But when they try to apply them in real life, they quickly run into a road block: “Buster is so stubborn!  He only listens if I have a treat.” Or, more broadly in casual conversations or online discussions: “You know, that’s… Read More  Read More

post-20243, Mean Dogs Wear Muzzles! (And Other Misconceptions), http://www.drjensdogblog.com/mean-dogs-wear-muzzles-and-other-misconceptions/, February 4 2019 , All right, gang.  Today, we’re going to be talking about muzzles. This is a topic that’s been on my mind a lot lately.  As a veterinarian in general practice, I often need to briefly muzzle dogs for medical procedures – which can occasionally be upsetting for owners.  And with my behavior clients, I often suggest using muzzles as a management tool for certain situations that might otherwise be risky for the humans or other dogs involved in our training plan. … Read More  Read More

post-18254, Getting Used To Things (Or Not): Habituation Vs. Sensitization, http://www.drjensdogblog.com/getting-used-to-things-or-not-habituation-vs-sensitization/, November 12 2018 , Not too long ago, one of my training clients told me about an unexpected problem she was having with her dog. She had recently moved from a rural area to a more suburban neighborhood, and had begun taking her dog for daily walks on-leash.  They both enjoyed their walks, apart from an issue they were having with a particular house along their route. There was a dog who lived in this house, and he barked at them through the window… Read More  Read More 
post-17858, If At First You Don’t Succeed, Do Something Different, http://www.drjensdogblog.com/if-at-first-you-dont-succeed-do-something-different/, October 15 2018 , When my dog Remy was a puppy, many years ago, I set about teaching him a sit-stay. As any trainer can attest, this is usually a fairly straightforward exercise.  I was still in veterinary school at that time, so I had less training experience than I do now – but as a student assistant in OSU’s puppy kindergarten classes twice a week, I had taught dozens of pups the basics of how to sit and stay without any difficulty. My… Read More  Read More 
post-17637, Why Ignoring Bad Behavior Doesn’t Work, http://www.drjensdogblog.com/why-ignoring-bad-behavior-doesnt-work/, September 17 2018 , For today’s topic, we’re going to delve a little deeper into an oft-repeated myth about positive training.  Namely, the idea that in order to train a well-mannered companion, you need to do two things: Reward what you like, and ignore what you don’t. Seems easy, right? Chances are, if you’re a dog owner, you’ve heard some version of this mantra somewhere along the way – from a well-meaning friend or neighbor, perhaps, or in an online training group.  And really,… Read More  Read More 
post-17459, Will My Puppy Grow Out Of This? Early Intervention For Behavior Issues, http://www.drjensdogblog.com/will-my-puppy-grow-out-of-this-early-intervention-for-behavior-issues/, August 20 2018 , As a veterinarian in general practice, seeing a brand new puppy for a wellness check-up is one of my favorite parts of the job. (I’d wager this is true for most vets – ask anyone!) Puppies are cute, and obnoxious, and very, very busy.  They sniff all around the exam room, jump up to say hello, and try their best to eat my shoelaces.  They chew on my stethoscope while I auscult their hearts.  They eat treats eagerly when offered,… Read More  Read More
